Signature is the seal of authenticity for most of the critical transactions like bank transactions. It is one of the prime tool for security. There are two types of signature verification systems i.e., the online signature verification system and the offline. In this paper, we have tried to classify the original off-line signatures from the forged one. We can consider signatures as artistic hand writings which involves flow and movement. Hence, we can consider it as an image. Clearly, we can employ Computer Vision techniques and Convolutional Neural Networks to extract features from the signature like pressure and speed which can help reason the authenticity of the signature.
